The ball is not where it's supposed to be and there is weird distortion.

The ball is still wrong but the distortion is gone, at the expense of the fov being hardcoded at 90Â°

The ball is now at the correct place! Also, planes can be bounded and reflections are working! Now it's also multithreaded!
